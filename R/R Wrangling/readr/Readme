See explanation, detail example for argument meaning in the file: './read rectangular file/delimited file.ipynb'
 
Most functions share the same argument (like skip_empty_rows, col_types, col_names, ....) so understand the above notebook is good enough to go.

If you’re reading a very large file, you might want to set n_max to a smallish number like 10,000 or 100,000. That will accelerate your iterations while you eliminate common problems.

If you’re having major parsing problems, sometimes it’s easier to just read into a character vector of lines with read_lines(), or even a character vector of length 1 with read_file(). Then you can use the string parsing skills you’ll learn later to parse more exotic formats.
