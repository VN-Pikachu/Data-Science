    "`lift_xy()` is a composition helper. It helps you compose functions by lifting their domain from a kind of input to another kind. The domain can be changed from and to a list (l), a vector (v) and dots (d). For example, `lift_ld(fun)` transforms a function taking a list to a function taking dots."

This is often essential for composition with purrr functional tools. Since this is such a common function, `lift()` is provided as an alias for that operation."
