# 4.1 Coding basics

In RStudio, use `Alt` + `-` to create ` <- `.  
Notice that RStudio automagically surrounds `<-` with spaces, which is a good code formatting practice.

# 4.2 What's in a name?
Object names must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, numbers,` _` and `.`. You want your object names to be descriptive, so youâ€™ll need a convention for multiple words.

```{r}
snake_case <- 1
camelCase <- 1
this.is.dot.case <- 1
```

# 4.3 Calling Functions

```{r}
seq
```
