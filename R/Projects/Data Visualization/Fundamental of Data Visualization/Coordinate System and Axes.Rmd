### Cartesian Coordinates

```{r}
points <- data.frame(x = c(-1, 2, 0), y = c(-1, 1, 0))

points %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-2, 3), ylim = c(-2, 2)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = x, xend = x, y = 0, yend = y), linetype = 'dashed') +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = x, y = y, yend = y), linetype = 'dashed') +
  geom_point(color = 'tomato', size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0('(', x, ',', y, ')')),
            hjust = 0, vjust = 0, 
            nudge_x = .1, nudge_y = .1) +
  annotate(x = c(-1, 2), y = c(-0.5, .5), 
           hjust = c(1.2, -0.2), vjust = .5,  
           label = paste0('y=', c(-1, 1)),
           geom = 'text') +
  annotate(x = c(-.5, 1), y = c(-1, 1), 
           hjust = .5, vjust = c(1.2, -0.2),  
           label = paste0('x=', c(-1, 2)),
           geom = 'text') +
  # annonate(x = c(), y = c(), vjust = c(1, -1))
  labs(x = 'x axis', y = 'y axis') + 
  theme_minimal()
```
Whenever the two axes are measured in different units, we can stretch or compress one relative to the other and maintain a valid visualization of the data (Figure 3.2). Which version is preferable may depend on the story we want to convey. A tall and narrow figure emphasizes change along the y axis and a short and wide figure does the opposite. Ideally, we want to choose an aspect ratio that ensures that any important differences in position are noticeable.

On the other hand, if the x and the y axes are measured in the same units, then the grid spacings for the two axes should be equal, such that the same distance along the x or y axis corresponds to the same number of data units.

### Non-linear Scale

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == 'Asia' & year == 2010 & !is.na(population)) %>%
  mutate(country = reorder(country, population)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(country, population)) +
  geom_col(fill = 'tomato') +
  scale_y_log10(breaks = 10 ^ (1:9), labels = paste0('10^', 1:9)) +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle('Population of Asian countries 2010') +
  theme_minimal() 
```

 In particular, ratios should generally be shown on a log scale.
