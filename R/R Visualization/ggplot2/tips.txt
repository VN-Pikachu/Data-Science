OVERPLOTTING:
The biggest potential problem with a scatterplot is overplotting: whenever you have more than a few points, points may be plotted on top of one another. This can severely distort the visual appearance of the plot. There is no one solution to this problem, but there are some techniques that can help. You can add additional information with geom_smooth(), geom_quantile() or geom_density_2d(). If you have few unique x values, geom_boxplot() may also be useful.

Alternatively, you can summarise the number of points at each location and display that in some way, using geom_count(), geom_hex(), or geom_density2d().

Another technique is to make the points transparent (e.g. geom_point(alpha = 0.05)) or very small (e.g. geom_point(shape = ".")).

------------------------
ggplot(tips, aes(total_bill, tip), color = sex):   
using color = sex is the same as in seaborn, set hue = 'sex'
different hue will have different EDGE_COLOR


ggplot(tips, aes(total_bill, tip), fill = sex):
`fill = sex` working like `hue = "sex"` in seaborn
different hue will have different FACE_COLOR
----------------------------
coord_trans
scale_x_log10
x_lim
y_lim
---------------------------
normalize: 
aes(y = after_stat(density))

do not normalize, keep frequency:
aes(y = after_stat(count))
---------------
In ggplot2, Most marker will not have facecolor, so try to set the value for edgecolor first, then facecolor
--------------
grammar:
size: linewidth
linetype: linestyle
stroke: marker linewidth
color: edgecolor
fill: facecolor
shape: marker
----------------------
horizontal alignment:
center: hjust = 0.5
left: hjust = 0
right: hjust = 1

vertical alignment:
bottom: vjust = 0
center: vjust = 0.5
top: vjust = 1
------------------------
transparent background: fill = NA
---------------------------
facet_grid(scales = 'fixed'): sharex = True, sharey = True in MATPLOTLIB
facet_grid(scales = 'free_x'): sharex = False in MATPLOTLIB
facet_grid(scales = 'free_y'): sharey = False in MATPLOTLIB
facet_grid(scales = 'free'): sharex = False, sharey = False in MATPLOTLIB
--------------------------
ggrepel:geom_text_repel 
Use this function to plot text (it will automatically handle overlapping text by reposition the texts)
